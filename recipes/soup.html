                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>The beauty of a creamy pumpkin soup (and this classic pumpkin soup recipe in particular) is that 
                it's so versatile and forgiving. It's one of the easiest meals to make with just a handful of ingredients, 
                and it's almost impossible to mess up.</p>

                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pumpkin</li>
                    <li>Onion</li>
                    <li>Leek</li>
                    <li>Cream</li>
                    <li>Spices and seasonings</li>
                    <li>Potato</li>
                    <li>Stock</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat oil in a large saucepan over low heat, 
                        add onion and leek and cook for 2-3 minutes, 
                        until softened but not coloured.</li>
                    <li>Add garlic, coriander, cumin, and nutmeg and cook, 
                        stirring, for 30 seconds. Add pumpkin, potato and stock 
                        and bring to the boil. Turn heat to low, cover and simmer for 
                        30 minutes. Allow to cool slightly, then blend in batches.</li>
                    <li>Return soup to pan, stir through cream and reheat gently. Season 
                        and add a little more nutmeg if desired.</li>
                </ol>

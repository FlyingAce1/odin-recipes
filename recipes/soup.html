    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The beauty of a creamy pumpkin soup (and this classic pumpkin soup recipe in particular) is that 
        it's so versatile and forgiving. It's one of the easiest meals to make with just a handful of ingredients, 
        and it's almost impossible to mess up.</p>

    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pumpkin</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Leek</li>
        <li>Cream</li>
        <li>Spices and seasongings</li>
        <li>Potato</li>
        <li>Stock</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large saucepan over low heat, 
            add onion and leek and cook for 2-3 minutes, 
            until softened but not coloured.</li>
        <li>Add garlic, coriander, cumin, and nutmeg and cook, 
            stirring, for 30 seconds. Add pumpkin, potato and stock 
            and bring to the boil. Turn heat to low, cover and simmer for 
            30 minutes. Allow to cool slightly, then blend in batches.</li>
        <li>Return soup to pan, stir through cream and reheat gently. Season 
            and add a little more nutmeg if desired.</li>

    </ol>
